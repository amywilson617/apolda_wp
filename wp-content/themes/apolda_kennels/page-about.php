    <h1> About Us </h1>

        <p class="body-copy"> Apolda Kennels was established in 1979 when the owner
          realized he had a deep love of animals after adopting his first dog.
          We truly have a passion for dogs and cats and take care of them on an
          individualized basis. We spend the time needed to groom or train a pet
          and never cut corners along the way. </p>

    <h1>Home Away From Home </h1>

    <p class="body-copy">No one likes to leave their pets behind for a long period of time, but travel and other
      circumstances often arise in life that create a temporary  separation from our companions. </p>

      <p class="body-copy">Apolda Kennels, located in Aurora, IL, ensures that your dog has as many comforts
      of home as possible. We are pet owners at Apolda as well, and deeply understand
      the role that pets play in our lives. </p>
