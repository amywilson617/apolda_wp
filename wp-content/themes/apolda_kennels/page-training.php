              <p class="body-copy"> <span class="big-italic"> A well-trained and well-behaved dog can be an
                even better canine family member.</span></p>

                <p class="body-copy"> For more than 25 years, we have helped train dogs and guide them
                toward achieving the goals of their owners for proper behavior.</p>

                <p class="body-copy">Apolda offers private sessions, which are completely individualized,
                and employ a variety of training and behavior modification techniques.
                These private sessions are especially recommended to correct severe problems.</p>

          <h3 class="gray-h3"> Individualized Training Sessions </h3>

                <p class="body-copy">Like humans, every dog is different. They each have
                their own personality, temperament, and certain factors that work to help
                further education, so Apolda understands that not every training
                session will be similar.</p>

                <p class="body-copy">Not only does a lot of what we do depend on the dog, it is based
                on what the owner wants, as well.</p>

                <p class="body-copy"> For example, if the owner wants them on a highly regimented schedule,
                we can make it happen. Others are simply looking to have a particular
                problem solved or a goal met, such as potty training, food training,
                or countless other issues.</p>
