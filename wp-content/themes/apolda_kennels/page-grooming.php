          <h3> Keep Your Pal Looking Their Best </h3>

              <p class="body-copy"> Keeping your pet groomed, clean, and looking
                their best is not only good for the looks and smell of our pals,
                it also can be healthier for them as well. For more than a quarter
                century, Apolda Kennels has been providing experienced and affordable
                grooming services in and around Aurora, IL. </p>

                <p class="body-copy"> Grooming your dog accomplishes several goals at one time.
                It makes the pet look, feel, and smell better as well as ridding
                and preventing invasive pests such as fleas and ticks. </p>

                <p class="body-copy"> Grooming also serves as an examination of the pet. After the
                groomer brushes, cuts, and clips, body areas rarely seen are exposed.
                This will allow the owner to know if their beloved companion
                may have scar tissue, lumps, or other life threatening issues. </p>

          <h3 class="gray-h3"> Services </h3>

              <p class="body-copy">Apolda offers two grooming options:
                <span class="red-bold">standard grooming session or bath. </span>
                With our standard grooming, the dog will receive all  important
                services such as a brush-out, nail trimming, ear
                cleaning, and anal expression. Haircuts include all of the above.
                The pet's anal glands are expressed and then bathed. After the bath,
                the dog is dried and given a haircut. For a simpler procedure for short-haired breeds,
                all of the above services can be performed excluding the haircut.</p>

          <h3 class="gray-h3"> Tailored to Your Every Need </h3>

              <p class="body-copy">As usual with Apolda, we tailor our services to your
                specifications. We will ask the owner if they would like their animal
                to look like their breed as closely as possible. We can specialize
                the look to the preferred breed for mixed breeds. Fees for our bathing
                and grooming services are variable on the size and coat of the dog. </p>
